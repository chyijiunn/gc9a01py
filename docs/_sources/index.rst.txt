gc9a01py Driver
===============

GC9A01 Display driver in MicroPython based on devbis st7789py_mpy module from
https://github.com/devbis/st7789py_mpy modified to drive 240x240 pixel GC9A01
displays.

The driver supports display rotation, mirroring, scrolling and drawing text
using 8 and 16 bit wide bitmap fonts with heights that are multiples of 8.
Included are 12 bitmap fonts derived from classic pc text mode fonts and a
couple of example programs.

This is a work in progress.

If you are looking for a faster driver with additional features, check out the
C version of the driver at https://github.com/russhughes/gc9a01_mpy
